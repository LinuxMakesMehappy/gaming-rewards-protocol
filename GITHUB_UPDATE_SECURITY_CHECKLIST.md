## 🚨 **Pre-Update Security Review**

### **✅ Security Checklist:**

#### **1. Sensitive Data Check**
- [ ] **No API keys in code** - Check for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] **No private keys** - Verify no wallet private keys
- [ ] **No database credentials** - Check for connection strings
- [ ] **No environment variables** - Ensure .env files are in .gitignore

#### **2. Security Vulnerabilities Review**
- [ ] **19 vulnerabilities identified** - Document in commit message
- [ ] **React version conflicts** - Note blocking issues
- [ ] **Rust code warnings** - Document 14 warnings found

#### **3. Code Quality Review**
- [ ] **Rust compilation** - ✅ Success with warnings
- [ ] **TypeScript compilation** - ❌ Blocked by React conflicts
- [ ] **WASM integration** - ✅ Successfully compiled

## 🛡️ **Security Procedures**

### **1. Pre-Commit Security Scan**
```bash
# Check for secrets in code
git diff --cached | grep -i "api_key\|secret\|password\|private"

# Verify .gitignore includes sensitive files
cat .gitignore | grep -E "\.env|node_modules|target|\.next"

# Check file permissions
find . -name "*.sh" -exec ls -la {} \;
```

### **2. Commit Security**
```bash
# Use signed commits if GPG key available
git commit -S -m "feat: Implement Rust+WASM security core with comprehensive audit"

# Or use regular commit with security notes
git commit -m "feat: Implement Rust+WASM security core with comprehensive audit"
```

### **3. Push Security**
```bash
# Push to main branch with security context
git push origin main

# Create security advisory if vulnerabilities found
# (Will be done after push)
```

## 📊 **Security Risk Assessment**

| Component | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Rust Core** | 🟢 LOW | ✅ Safe to commit |
| **WASM Integration** | 🟢 LOW | ✅ Safe to commit |
| **Smart Contracts** | 🟢 LOW | ✅ Safe to commit |
| **Frontend Code** | 🟡 MEDIUM | ⚠️ Document vulnerabilities |
| **Dependencies** | 🔴 HIGH | ⚠️ Document in commit message |

## 🎯 **Update Procedure**

### **Step 1: Security Review**
```bash
# Review all files for sensitive data
git diff --cached

# Check for any secrets or keys
grep -r "api_key\|secret\|password" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
```

### **Step 2: Add Files Securely**
```bash
# Add all safe files
git add .

# Verify what's being committed
git status
```

### **Step 3: Commit with Security Context**
```bash
# Commit with comprehensive security message
git commit -m "feat: Implement Rust+WASM security core with comprehensive audit
