```

#### Rust
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```

#### Solana CLI
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.17.0/install)"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Anchor CLI
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gaming-rewards-protocol

# Run the automated setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
# Edit the environment file
cp env.example .env
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Required API Keys:**
- `STEAM_API_KEY` - Get from [Steam Developer](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
- `JUPITER_API_KEY` - Get from [Jupiter](https://station.jup.ag/)

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# The interface will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Commands

### Build
```bash
# Build all modules
npm run build

# Build specific module
npm run build:core
npm run build:contracts
npm run build:validation
npm run build:interface
```

### Test
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run security tests
npm run test:security

# Run specific tests
npm run test:core
npm run test:contracts
```

### Deploy
```bash
# Deploy to devnet
npm run deploy:devnet

# Deploy to mainnet (production)
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

## Testing the Protocol

### 1. Connect Wallet
- Open http://localhost:3000
- Click "Connect Wallet" and connect your Solana wallet
- Make sure you're on devnet

### 2. Authenticate with Steam
- Click "Authenticate with Steam"
- Enter a valid Steam ID (17 digits)
- Or use the Steam OpenID login

### 3. View Achievements
- Browse your Steam achievements
- Filter by claimed/unclaimed status
- Sort by date, rarity, or name

### 4. Claim Rewards
- Click "Claim Reward" on unclaimed achievements
- Confirm the transaction in your wallet
- View your earned rewards

### 5. Stake Rewards
- Navigate to the Staking section
- Choose amount and lock period
- Earn additional rewards through staking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Node.js version too old"
```bash
# Update Node.js
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

#### "Solana CLI not found"
```bash
# Add Solana to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

#### "Anchor build failed"
```bash
# Update Anchor
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

#### "Steam API errors"
- Verify your Steam API key is correct
- Check if the Steam ID is valid (17 digits)
- Ensure the Steam profile is public

#### "Jupiter swap failed"
- Check your Solana wallet has SOL for fees
- Verify you're connected to the correct network (devnet/mainnet)
- Check Jupiter API key configuration

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=true npm run dev

# View detailed logs
tail -f logs/gaming-rewards.log
```
