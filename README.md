# Gaming Rewards Protocol - Zero-CVE Jupiter Core

## Security-First Architecture

This protocol implements a zero-CVE policy with NSA/CIA/DOD-level security standards. All code follows strict security guidelines with no emojis and minimal complexity.

## Core Architecture

### Jupiter Integration
- Instant liquidity provision via Jupiter pools
- No unstaking periods for seamless user experience
- Dual rewards: gaming achievements + Jupiter fees
- Real-time swap execution for instant reward claims

### Steam Validation
- Steam OpenID authentication
- Steam API achievement verification
- Steam session ticket validation
- Multi-layer fraud detection system

### Security Implementation
- Zero-CVE policy across all dependencies
- Defense-in-depth security architecture
- Zero-trust network design
- Complete audit trail implementation
