# Security Audit Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The Gaming Rewards Protocol implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security audit pipeline designed to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities across the entire project. This pipeline operates continuously and provides both automated and manual security assessment capabilities.

## Pipeline Components

- Anti-pattern detection

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/security-audit.sh
```

#### `scripts/rust-audit.sh`

**Features**:
- Scheduled execution (24-hour intervals)
- Comprehensive issue tracking
- Alert generation
- Report generation
- Log management
- Vulnerability monitoring
- Dependency tracking

**Usage**:
```bash
# Normal execution (respects timing)
./scripts/continuous-audit.sh

# Force execution
./scripts/continuous-audit.sh force

# Generate report only
./scripts/continuous-audit.sh report

# Cleanup only
./scripts/continuous-audit.sh cleanup
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

#### `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`
**Triggers**:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests to main branch
- Daily scheduled execution (2 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs**:
1. **security-audit**: Runs all audit scripts
2. **dependency-check**: Checks for vulnerabilities and updates
3. **code-quality**: Runs linting and type checking
4. **security-scan**: Runs Trivy and Bandit scanners
5. **notify**: Generates reports and notifications

## Security Checks

### Critical Security Checks

#### 1. Hardcoded Secrets Detection
- Private keys in code
- API keys in source files
- Database credentials
- Authentication tokens

#### 2. Smart Contract Security
- Unchecked arithmetic operations
- Missing access controls
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Input validation gaps
- Rate limiting bypasses

#### 3. Bot Security
- Insecure key handling
- Missing error handling
- Input validation gaps
- Rate limiting issues
- Insecure API usage

### High Severity Checks

#### 1. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Known security vulnerabilities
- Outdated packages
- Malicious packages
- License compliance

#### 2. Configuration Security
- Environment file exposure
- Insecure defaults
- Missing security headers
- Weak authentication

#### 3. Code Quality Issues
- Security anti-patterns
- Unused imports
- Dead code
- Poor error handling

### Medium Severity Checks

#### 1. Documentation Gaps
- Missing function documentation
- Incomplete security documentation
- Outdated README files
- Missing API documentation

#### 2. Testing Coverage
- Missing unit tests
- Incomplete integration tests
- No security tests
- Poor test quality

#### 3. Monitoring Gaps
- Missing error monitoring
- No performance monitoring
- Incomplete logging
- Missing alerting

## Issue Severity Levels

### CRITICAL
- Immediate action required
- Security vulnerabilities that could lead to:
  - Fund loss
  - Unauthorized access
  - System compromise
  - Data breach

### HIGH
- Action required within 24 hours
- Security issues that could lead to:
  - Potential vulnerabilities
  - System instability
  - Performance degradation

### MEDIUM
- Action required within 1 week
- Issues that should be addressed but don't pose immediate risk

### LOW
- Action required within 1 month
- Code quality and best practice issues

## Alert System

### Alert Channels
1. **GitHub Issues**: Automatic issue creation for critical/high severity findings
2. **Log Files**: Detailed audit logs in `audit/` directory
3. **Email/Slack**: Placeholder for external notification integration
4. **PR Comments**: Automatic comments on pull requests

### Alert Content
- Issue severity and description
- File and line number location
- Recommended fix
- Impact assessment
- Timeline for resolution

## Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- **Daily**: Full security audit
- **On Commit**: Quick security scan
- **On PR**: Comprehensive review
- **Weekly**: Dependency update check

### Manual Checks
- **Monthly**: Deep security review
- **Quarterly**: External security audit
- **On Release**: Pre-deployment security check

## Report Generation

### Audit Reports
- **Location**: `audit/audit-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
- **Content**: Executive summary, findings, recommendations
- **Retention**: 30 days

### Summary Reports
- **Location**: `audit/audit-summary.log`
- **Content**: Issue counts, trends, statistics
- **Retention**: Permanent

### Alert Logs
- **Location**: `audit/security-alerts.log`
- **Content**: All security alerts with timestamps
- **Retention**: 30 days

## Integration Points

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Pre-commit hooks
- Build-time security checks
- Deployment security validation
- Post-deployment monitoring

### External Tools
- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency scanning
- **Cargo audit**: Rust dependency scanning

### Monitoring Services
- **Sentry**: Error monitoring and alerting
- **GitHub Security**: Vulnerability alerts
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Run local audit before committing
2. Address all critical and high severity issues
3. Document security decisions
4. Review audit reports regularly

### Security Review Process
1. Automated audit triggers
2. Manual review of findings
3. Issue prioritization
4. Fix implementation
5. Re-audit verification

### Incident Response
1. Immediate issue assessment
2. Impact evaluation
3. Fix implementation
4. Verification testing
5. Documentation update

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for external integrations
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=your_smtp_server

# Optional configuration
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=30
AUDIT_SCHEDULE_HOURS=24
ALERT_THRESHOLD=HIGH
```

### Customization
- Modify audit scripts for project-specific checks
- Add custom security rules
- Integrate with existing monitoring systems
- Configure alert thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Script permissions**: Ensure scripts are executable
2. **Missing dependencies**: Install required tools
3. **Path issues**: Verify script paths
4. **Git hooks**: Check pre-commit configuration

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug output
DEBUG=1 ./scripts/security-audit.sh

# Verbose logging
VERBOSE=1 ./scripts/continuous-audit.sh
```

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update audit rules monthly
- Review and update dependencies
- Monitor for new security tools
- Update documentation
